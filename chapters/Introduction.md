# Introduction to Biology and Molecular Biology

We will cover the overview of molecular biology, including the central
dogma, the structures and functions of key biomolecules, and the role of
gene expression in cellular function. Then, we’ll delve into genes and
genomes, types of RNA, and the intricate mechanisms of gene expression
regulation.

## Overview of Molecular Biology

Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the
molecular basis of biological activity, particularly how genetic
information is stored, replicated, and expressed to drive cellular
processes. At its core lies the **central dogma of molecular biology**,
a foundational theory proposed by Francis Crick in 1958 and refined over
decades. This dogma describes the unidirectional flow of genetic
information: from DNA to RNA to protein. In essence, DNA serves as the
blueprint, RNA as the intermediary messenger, and proteins as the
functional workhorses of the cell.

To elaborate, during **transcription**, a segment of DNA is copied into
RNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase, producing a complementary RNA strand.
This RNA, if it’s messenger RNA (mRNA), then undergoes **translation**
in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes read the RNA sequence in groups of
three nucleotides (codons) to assemble amino acids into proteins. While
the central dogma is generally unidirectional, exceptions exist, such as
reverse transcription in retroviruses, where RNA is converted back to
DNA by reverse transcriptase. This framework is crucial because it
explains how genetic information is preserved and utilized, forming the
basis for fields like genomics and transcriptomics.

Next, let’s examine **the structure and function of DNA, RNA, and
proteins**. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a double-stranded helical
molecule composed of nucleotides—each consisting of a deoxyribose sugar,
a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A),
thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G). The strands are held together
by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases (A-T and C-G), allowing
for stable storage and faithful replication during cell division. DNA’s
primary function is to store genetic information, which can be passed
from one generation to the next.
